# DFRobot_MAX17043

* [中文版](./README_CN.md)

The MAX17043 is ultra-compact, low-cost,host-side fuel-gauge systems for lithium-ion (Li+) batter-ies in handheld and portable 
equpiment.It employs Gravity I2C interface,ultra-low opearting current, and real-time tracking of the relative state of charge 
(SOC) of the battery through Maxim's patented algorithm,eliminating the need for full-to-empty relearning and offset accumualtion 
errors.Plug and play to accurately measure the voltage and remaining power of the battery. The module  also features as a low 
battery power alert interrupt function.  When the battery power falls below specified threshold, the ALR pin generates a falling 
pluse to trigger the external interrupt of the controller.One thing should mention that the default value of the battery low power
interrupt alert threshold is 32%, this threshold can be set by the function set_interrupt().

## Summary
Provides a microPython library for reading and interperting MAX17043 data over I2C.

## Connection
Wires of the same color are linked together,and We only exemplify how this board is connected to the Fuel Gauge.
When connecting , it is necessary to pay attention to the correspondence among pins, the connection diagram is as fellows.
