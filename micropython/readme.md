# DFRobot_MAX17043 Gravityï¼š3.7V Li Battery Fuel Gauge

The MAX17043 is ultra-compact, low-cost,host-side fuel-gauge systems for lithium-ion (Li+) batter-ies in handheld and portable 
equpiment.It employs Gravity I2C interface,ultra-low opearting current, and real-time tracking of the relative state of charge 
(SOC) of the battery through Maxim's patented algorithm,eliminating the need for full-to-empty relearning and offset accumualtion 
errors.Plug and play to accurately measure the voltage and remaining power of the battery. The module  also features as a low 
battery power alert interrupt function.  When the battery power falls below specified threshold, the ALR pin generates a falling 
pluse to trigger the external interrupt of the controller.One thing should mention that the default value of the battery low power
interrupt alert threshold is 32%, this threshold can be set by the function setInterrupt().

When connecting , it is necessary to pay attention to the correspondence among pins, the connection diagram is as fellows.
